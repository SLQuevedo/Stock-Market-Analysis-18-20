# Challenge-2

Inside the folder are screenshots for 2018-2020. 

For each year I filtered through unique ticker values, calulated the yearly stock change, yearly percent change and the total volume increase.
I also found what ticker had the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease and greatest total volume. 

The .bas file contains the code that I wrote to accomplish these tasks. Please import it into visual basic to view the code.
My code is annotated, so I hope it is easy to follow.


Thanks for reading!
